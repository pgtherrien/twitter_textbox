"As listed in the above document, cryptoequity is not simply a cryptotoken that ostensibly represents a stock, it encompasses all types of programmable rights that can potentially apply to a project. There are many potential applications of cryptoequity that fall into the realm of securities and equally many that do not.<p>Fundamentally what we are trying to do is stay on the right side of what is a very fuzzy line between what we can and can&#x27;t do, while offering something that is incrementally but substantially better than all previous funding platforms.

"Given what you've said here, I highly suspect you do long-term fasting within some sort of ""yogic"" context. I personally suspect that many of the potentially negative outcomes of dietary depravation are mitigated when in a positive environment (i.e. lots of nature / with good energies) complemented with certain types of yogic practices. There is also a long tradition of long ""fasts"" within Chinese qigong traditions, and the supposition is usually that a body attuned via various practices can feed off of the environmental energies (e.g. the sun, the mountain) without needing nutrients of other sorts. The technical aspect of some of these things is a bit beyond me, both because it is 'esoteric' and doesn't fit into any model of Western science that I know of (with the potential exception of Paracelsusians).<p>Along these lines, I'm curious what sort of environment you or the other people you know do their long fasts in (i.e. if there is a checklist of sorts)."
"So do you think that the US higher-ed system is inherently flawed also, with competition between high achievers (i.e. Harvard) and schools that anyone can get into? It&#x27;s true that there are more resources associated with success, but doesn&#x27;t that also incentivize people to work harder to end up in the higher bracket? I don&#x27;t see the &quot;Class-C&quot; problem as necessarily a problem, so long as the person in &quot;Class-C&quot; has the opportunity to get back to Class-A by putting in the appropriate work.<p>My own feeling (having also observed higher ed in Europe and Asia and other places) is that the US system works better for cultivating high achievement, but less well at making sure that lower achievers maintain a certain level of quality. This means that there is more spread over the bell curve and less in the center. Europeans, on the other hand, seem to prefer more clustering in the center of the bell curve.<p>This is equally true for wealth acquisition, btw, with Europeans generally preferring not to have extremes (i.e. extremely high wage earners or extremely low wage earners)."

"I would be interested in learning how that experiment goes.

"My estimate is that the US currently spends roughly $3 Billion (with a B) on medical care for a mere 30,000 people with CF.  This is mostly covered by insurance, state aid, federal aid, and charities.  The families are typically under enormous financial stress and can ill afford to spend money on some risky unproven source of advice, which is the category my experiences fall into.  I think it's very repeatable and people who have chosen to act on even limited bits of my advice have reported very good results.  I have so far not had anyone tell me ""I tried that and it so failed"".  Given the degree to which I am routinely vilified by the CF community (for advocating ""dangerous"" things like eating better), I strongly suspect if there were any significant failures of my approach, I would never hear the end of it.<p>The fundamental problem appears to be that people define CF in the following manner (quote from a doctor): ""People like you don't get well.""  Since I got well, I must be lying. I can't really have CF.<p>I have no plans to charge money for information.  I have no idea how it would be monetized.  I generally assume I am better off pursuing other things for money and keeping this fairly low on the radar.  Attempts to shout it from the rooftops has only served to convince people in the CF that I am a liar, a charlatan and a snake oil salesman -- that I suffer from Munchhausen Syndrome and am doing this out of a sick need for attention rather than a sincere desire to help other people like me.<p>Anyway, there is a link to my site in my profile. It's the one with the word ""health"" in the URL. :-)  I have no idea how that $3 billion could be tapped into to support a saner, more humane and cheaper treatment approach.  God knows I would be on it in a heartbeat if I could figure that out as I have a pile of debts from getting myself well.<p>Peace."
"<i>The boy's parents chose to wait and rack up a $280,000 hospital bill, but did no one explain to them that a simple $80 procedure can prevent serious complications?</i><p>I think it's partly rooted in the mental models we have about medical stuff and their costs.  I can't tell you how often I hear someone tell me that eating better is ""too expensive"" an option for improving their health.  In many cases, it's a matter of a few bucks a month a month compared to sometimes literally thousands of dollars a month in medical expenses.  But food comes out of their pocket and a big medical crisis they think someone else will help cover. I think.<p>I don't get it myself.  Just tossing that out there."

"FWIW: I played <i>Simcity</i> for years.  My sons sold me on <i>Master of Magic</i> by emphasizing the city-building aspects of <i>Master of Magic</i>.

"I was at work all day, so I was unaware of any downvoting.  I don't believe I was ranting (unless you mean the remark about the purple polka dotted dancing singing pill).  The reality of the situation is as extreme as I describe it.  I don't think you can get it across in brief without ""hyperbole"".  I have no reason to believe anyone here would want the long version, with the statistics on death rates (mean age of survival:  37 in the US), drug use (many people with CF are on $3000.00 to $4000.00 per month worth of ""maintenance drugs"" -- ie when they aren't considered ""sick""), frequent hospitalizations (many people are go in once or twice a year for a ""tune up"" -- ie when they ""aren't sick"" -- and can be hospitalized multiple times per year as they deteriorate)....and on and on. The statistics are really gruesome.<p>There is good reason why I get greeted with so much shock and hostility by much of the CF community:  The things I say can be done fly in the face of everything these people know to be true.  I don't see any reason why my statements would be greeted any more warmly and acceptingly here. &#60;shrug&#62;"

"I'm sure it doesn't fit well with current expectations for ""convenience"" in America.  But I can't imagine why climate would be an objection.<p>Historically, vernacular architecture here did cater to local climate -- back when you couldn't just crank the AC, houses in the South did use passive solar design to help keep homes and lifestyles livably cool.  Plantations had a second smaller kitchen outside the main house to avoid heating up the main house during the summer months.  Modern Southerners still often grill out during the summer months and upscale modern homes may have ""outdoor kitchens"" equipped with a place to eat, an upscale built-in grill, prep space and so on.  The deep, wrap-around porches seen on some Southern homes not only prevent summer sun from heating the main house, they also made it possible to leave windows open for cross-draft ventilation in spite of nearly daily afternoon storms during the summer and into the fall."

The truth can suck -- and also sets you free.  I embrace it.  It's a big part of how I am getting well.  But I am much less of a danger to others these days because I am so much healthier.  And other people are still more of a danger to me than I am to them.  I still have a compromised immune system.  We are all crawling with millions if not billions of microbes. You cannot even digest your food without them.  Some microbes that are relatively benign in some populations are very dangerous to others.  There are germs that create deadly infections in people with CF that are deemed benign for most normal people.<p>Peace.

"""A picture's worth a thousand words.""<p>Voices have their good points.  They convey a lot of emotion and such.  On the other hand, I found that has a big downside as well, especially when dealing with something like a serious health crisis:  People can't keep negative emotions out of their voices, emotions which can be unwelcome to the person in crisis.  If you are dying and wanting to ""get a life"", not dealing with the emotions in someone's voice can be a benefit of being online.  To me, it's not ""more real"" or ""less real"".  It's just a different means to communicate, one with different strengths and weaknesses.  It's better suited for some things, less well suited for others, but to me it is no less ""real"".<p>Oh, and have an upvote."

"<i>That said, I’m not sure I see the problem with naming those who are responsible.</i><p>One of the problems with naming names is that there are two sides to every story, so it tends to lead to &quot;he said, she said&quot; and tends to get very ugly -- the man has reason to defend himself and often feels he didn&#x27;t do anything wrong and may not have been intentionally bad. Another is that the <i>woman</i> who does so harms her <i>own</i> reputation. Who the hell will want to work with her if they know that should they crack an off color joke or make some other faux pas, she will go all SJW on them and seek to publicly hang them high?<p>Women are never going to get anywhere if they continue to jump on their high horse every time they have a run in with some guy. It is the men who have power. We (women -- as I am one) have to find a way to work with them if we want to get anywhere. And learning to sidestep trouble and frame things as innocently as they are reasonably able to be framed is a path forward. Jumping to ugly conclusions and starting a shitshow every time something happens is not.<p>The author was a CEO who apparently did multi-million dollar deals. I suspect she knows whereof she speaks. The shitshows we have seen posted to HN mostly seem to be women who are less successful than that.<p>I say this as someone who was molested and raped as a kid, who talks openly about that fact and what it did to me yet I have protected the identities of the perpetrators, for quite a lot of reasons. So this is something I have firsthand experience with.<p>The other problem is that naming names tends to not let it be a growth experience for men who screwed up because they just did not know any better. We all inherit an awful lot of shit culturally (I grew up in the deep south -- here is me talking about stupid racist assumptions I did not know I had and how I became aware of them: <a href=""http://ask.metafilter.com/261222/How-can-I-practice-gratitude-while-recognizing-and-fighting-injustice#3794660"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.metafilter.com&#x2F;261222&#x2F;How-can-I-practice-gratitud...</a>) You have to start with the assumption that men are just as much a victim of circumstance as women if we are ever going to find a path forward.<p>Once you out a man, he is publicly branded. Once that is done, he is much more likely to feel compelled to justify his actions to himself. That means he is likely to keep being an asshole and not become more sensitive to the issue. That does not let us, as a culture, move forward. Nailing men to the cross for relatively harmless assholery keeps all of us, as a group, pinned in place. I would like to move forward. The status quo sucks. I do not wish to do anything which prevents progress.<p>I am not saying that names should never be named. But the kinds of things described in the article, while definitely deal-breakers socially and in terms of business, are relatively harmless. She is not talking about being beaten and raped. She is not talking about the sort of thing that would justify calling the police and having him charged, criminally."
"Thanks for the feedback on the book.<p>As for your last paragraph: I have been homeless for about 2.5 years. Programs to &quot;help the homeless&quot; mostly really, really suck and a lot of them a) piss away the time of the intended recipients b) require the intended recipients to accept enormous disrespect and c) reinforce a subsistence existence. Many of the programs that look to get poor people off the street require you to first be guilty of something, admit your guilt and then be their property.<p>I have no doubt that it isn&#x27;t exactly consciously intentional but those attitudes are in there somewhere or this would be better. (There are some programs that are better than that but the default model is pretty awful, to the point of being actively hostile.)"
"Let me try to put that another way: I get the distinct impression that many men find it threatening to have the tables turned and struggle to remain in control of a process where they are used to initiating. I have put a lot of thought into how it works to signal receptivity selectively because it really has gone extremely poorly for me to initiate, even though I have a long track record of being heavily sought after by men. I have trouble reconciling the two sets of experiences without viewing it as mostly rooted in biased social expectations about who is allowed to do the asking."

So imagining that a maximum entropy universe will result in the quasi violation of the first law of thermodynamics is ridicule. See: [1] Energy will not cease to exist, yes, but I also think that the transformations of excited energy states won&#x27;t stop.<p>As an example: &quot;Where does the fire go, after you blow it out? The question is irritating, because fire is a side-effect of quantum interactions, while the wind that blew it off, absorbs and vaporizes this energy into measurable quanta and is comparable to what black holes do.<p>The rate at which vapors of flames excess from this reaction, is dependant of composition of the matter and it&#x27;s catalyzation rate. 
The flame contains many atoms with electrons in highly excited states and keeps decaying into lower energy levels, causing the excess energy to swing in the frequencies&#x2F;wavelengths or just colors&#x2F;spectra of the burning material. You can learn more about that in [2].<p>Why this seemingly unrelated example of &quot;fire and flames&quot; is simply explained as an <i>„autocatalytic set“</i> [3].<p>Adding that matter is both particle AND wave dependant on the observation is very simple to understand, when you know that we live in a two dimensional space and that energy outside of our space exists as a wave function.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_Rip</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/quantum_theory_origins/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pitt.edu&#x2F;~jdnorton&#x2F;teaching&#x2F;HPS_0410&#x2F;chapters&#x2F;qua...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalytic_set"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autocatalytic_set</a>"

"I too want to add the first item into the shopping basket from the laptop and the second from my tablet.<p>But this does not imply that the clients should store no state - it only implies that the state as <i>perceived</i> by the users needs to be the same. Different from how it is implemented.<p>While we are at the topic of state, why do I have to subscribe to a service just to be able to add the bookmark on one device and use it on the other ?<p>I view the two problems as congruent (except the bookmarks state is global, thus there is no ""server"" to offload the state onto) - but at the same time this difference highlights the assumption that there is ""The Server"" for the web app. What if there weren't ? Can we push the model a bit further and make it p2p - and I am pretty sure that as the homomorphic crypto advances, we will be able to do so even for the untrusted peers. Then there's no ""server"" anymore to store the state in.<p>Then, you have the DoS bit. Absolutely correctly the HTTP routers are the most loaded and hard to scale element of the whole setup. If you offload the state on the client, then you can ""dumb down"" the task of the non-initial content switching decision, based on the trustable client state.<p>So, I think that <i>distributing the state</i> is a good idea. What is limiting is the <i>naive distributing the state</i> - and this is where I agree with your assessment.

<i>As a sidenote, this difference of experience highlights a big problem with rich web applications.<p>You get so high variance in performance depending on a particular combination of hardware, OS and browser that you are virtually predestined to fail hard for some non-negligible part of your userbase (unless your application is so trivial that even on the worst possible platform it would still work ok).<p>I know, this problem existed with classical games all the time.

"Maximum firing rate differs between neuron types (i.e., cortical pyramidal neurons versus cerebellar Purkinje neurons) dependent upon cellular membrane properties (dendrite diameter and ion channel distributions, etc.), but a good rule-of-thumb to keep in mind is 1 kHz. That maximum ""firing rate"" is about as fast as a patch of membrane can generate an action potential (AP, or ""spike""), reset, and fire another.<p>All that said, a relevant question to ask is, ""What is the information content of a single action potential?"" There is not an agreed-upon answer among neuroscientists. The metaphor linking brain and a personal computer is extremely strained: to start, it is not quite true that neurons can carry out logical functions. Neurons are firmly rooted in the analog domain and it is much more straightforward to infer polynomial-type computations from their physiology, the order and coefficients being dictated by the particulars of the scenario. Also, the current thinking is that information is encoded in bursts or repetitive APs, called ""spike trains"". But if we must, I'd throw out a range of 0.5 to 5 bits per spike [Rieke, et al.]. (If you want to go down a rabbit hole and explore one of <i>the</i> pivotal topics among people studying neural computation, look up ""rate coding"" versus ""temporal coding"". Perhaps even phrasing the question that way is misleading.)<p>Here's a side note that may be of interest: during an AP, the trans-membrane voltage swings from approximately -100 mV to +100 mV (very rough figures). If you consider that this potential difference is applied across the 3 nano-meter thick cell membrane, the resulting electric field is very close to the dielectric breakdown voltage for phospholipid membranes. Our neurons are constantly operating within a factor or two of literally destroying themselves! (The preceding paragraph contains very back-of-the-envelope reasoning. To be more rigorous, I'd have to dig out my notes and reference materials, but the general point nonetheless holds.)"

Then create a JS singleton with your desired methods to be the image buffer's API. Thus, you're granted pixel-level access to the image and could (slowly) do whatever sort of processing you desire in JS."

Disabling transitions where possible is one of the first things I do after installing a new OS, be it Windows or OSX.<p>That's the danger of transitions too, the desire to go overboard for the aesthetic and end up frustrating users as things take too long to happen, even if they delight the first time they are seen.

"Looks they try competing against Cloudera and its HUE by having their own distro/management tool. Guess it's good news for hadoop eco-system.
1) ""Red Hat vs SuSE"" in linux analogy - such distro competition generated some confusions &#38; lots of 'ahead power' to many sub-projects, e.c. kvm vs xen.
2) Fragmentation of piece of technology is dangerous? I don't think so. Hadoop already has a unified code base in Apache where both Hortonworks and Cloudera's contributions go back. I think ""fragmentation"" at the this layer where standardizations aren't always required is good thing."

"Every TCP/UDP endpoint (such as a client or a server) maintains a state-table. As you might guess, it stores the state of each connection. You can view it using the 'netstat' command on Windows and Linux.<p>Bittorrent tends to create several entries in the state-table (since you're typically connected to hundred of seeds/leeches), which are each stored in memory, and uses up CPU resources to setup/maintain/teardown.<p>So if you were downloading a file via, say, Rapidshare, there'd be probably 1 TCP (you can configure your browser to use more) connection for your router to track, and do the necessary TCP handshakes, acknowledgments, RWIN scaling etc. Multiply all that's necessary for 1 TCP connection by N, where N is the number of peers you're connected to, and the limited resources on a $60 router get used up fast.<p>Early models of the now-famous Linksys WRT54G could reliably be crashed by torrenting while using stock firmware. A power-cycle was necessary to get it running again. Fun times.<p>However, all this only applies if you're running the router in NAT mode, which means the router takes the IP address from your ISP, and acts as the endpoint on behalf of your computer. If the router is running in bridged mode, then your computer acts as the endpoint, as much more equipped to handle large numbers of TCP connections.<p>Edit: Formatting, Grammar."

"We surveyed the founders after the last batch.  Their
main gripes were:<p>1. There aren't enough social events, especially early in the
cycle.  So we're adding more.<p>2. Founders were surprised how harsh our feedback was at times.
We may be able to be more diplomatic.  But I think the fundamental
problem is that this is a domain where, so far at least, many
participants fail.  So if you're truthful, you're often
going to be delivering bad news.<p>3. The speakers got swarmed after talks, because there were
some founders who schmoozed with all the speakers as a matter
of course, instead of giving priority to others with
specific reasons to talk to that speaker.  We have a plan to
fix this.<p>4. The acoustics in the orange room are a disaster.  When the room's full of people talking you have to yell to be heard.  Kate is having a huge
sound-absorbing curtain made to fix this.<p>5. It's too inflexible that office hour slots are exactly 25 minutes.
Different problems need varying amounts of time.  So we'll make
the slots adjustable.<p>6. Founders wanted a more organized way of getting and sharing
feedback about specific investors, so we're going to build
something for that.<p>7. We have to start teaching founders about fundraising earlier
in the cycle, because investors are approaching them earlier."

"A startup has to be in the same place as its investors if they want to talk face to face, and empirically we&#x27;ve found this to be a necessity when talking about the subtle and complicated problems startups face.  Email and Skype are such poor substitutes that they&#x27;re a qualitatively different thing.  Which means if a startup wants advice from its investors as well as money, they either have to raise money from local investors or one of them has to go to where the other is, at least temporarily."

"As I've mentioned before, the average age of the founders of Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24.  So judging from the evidence, 25 is not young for this kind of work.<p>From what I've seen, 21 is young, in the sense that there are a lot of people who aren't ready yet at that age.  But by 25 the kind of people who make good founders are ready.<p>I suspect the phenomenon is more social than biological.  The problem with the 21 year olds is that college tends to preserve some childish illusions about how the world works. So the reason 24-25 is the sweet spot is that it's far enough away from college for those illusions to have worn off."

"In my experience it's very rare for employees with vested stock to get ripped off in an acquisition.  Usually the amounts involved are so small that it would not be worth the bad publicity.<p>Curiously enough, one of the consequences of the rise of YC-like investors is that it will no longer be so easy to pull the sort of trick you claim Oracle pulled.

"There are 2 single founder startups in the current YC batch.  I think there were 3 in the last one.  So we do fund them. The odds of getting funded are lower for single founder startups.  I once calculated about 5x worse.  But that doesn't necessarily mean anything, because the single founder applicants are not simply the same kind of people as the multi-founder applicants, just in quantity one.  When people apply for funding for perpetual motion machines and the like, they are disproportionately single founders."
"Anyone who proposes that the discussion should focus on profitability rather than funding rounds is presumably not proposing that we simply talk about it as one bit of information: profitable or not.  That would make pretty short articles.  It also wouldn't be very interesting; there are hundreds of plumbers and barbers and cafes within a few miles of me who are profitable.<p>And plenty of these plumbers and barbers and cafes probably do great work and treat their employees well.  Do you really want to read articles about all of them?  I don't.  What makes a company newsworthy (unless it's as a case study) is its size, or potential size."
"Don't worry about the words.  I think what these apparently conflicting quotes are about is optimism management.

"Actually there was more business-oriented boosterism when we first launched.

"The middle to higher end of that range, maybe more.  It only tends to happen in high valuation deals (usually later funding rounds) so a little stock is usually worth a lot."
"You don't miss out, because introductions flow so freely.  It's not hard to find someone two hops from anyone you want to meet, and once you've done that (if you seem worth introducing), the two hops happen fast."
"Empirically the answer seems to be that working hard is a necessary if not sufficient condition for doing great things, and for getting rich in particular.<p>It's an interesting question why you can't simply find suckers who like to work hard, and get rich off their efforts while you sit back and do nothing.  One reason is that they'd have to be stupid to let you do that, and it's not much use having stupid people working for you, no matter how hard they work.  <p>Another reason is that having people work for you is not zero work for you. You have to tell them what to do, and often this requires a great deal of effort.  In fact, it's probably not possible to have good ideas about what to do in some field without at some point having worked hard in it yourself."

"This is written as if convertible debt financings were like regular debt, where if you can't pay a loan back by a certain time, you're in default and bad things happen to you.  That's not how it works in practice.  Investors who fund a startup using convertible debt are not hoping the debt will be repaid, like a regular lender is; they want it to convert to equity.  So in practice if there's no equity round by the end of the term, the debt either gets converted or the term gets extended.<p>It's not like convertible debt was invented in 2010.  I've seen many startups hit the end of the term of a convertible note before raising an equity round, and it has never once been a problem."

"The consumers are in fact patronizing the producers by consuming the product the producers create.  Not paying what the producer asks in exchange is the ""wrong"" part.<p>The free market says that the producer can ask what it wants in exchange for the product. If the consumer doesn't want to pay it, the consumer should not consume it.  Consumption without paying does not mean the consumer does not believe the product has no value.  Obviously it has value if the consumer consumes it."

"I like your summary of the talk. One subtly to his position that made the talk stand out for me was that he wasn't completely opposed to the top-down model for determining the weight of subjects in schools based on industry demands. Rather, his argument was that schools weren't keeping up with the needs of the industry they educate their students for. He seemed to be making the case that as an increasing number of the methodical aspects of industry become automated as technology progresses, problems which require more creativity such as determining ""what"" to make rather than ""how"" to make it become much more important."

"I can sort of see the benefit of using it as a serialization format. Use it to replace the db for some things or instead of a configuration file.

There's nothing wrong with django-bcrypt. The main reason for picking PBKDF2 is because it can be implemented without pulling in a dependency to the core framework.

"Keep in mind that that ""Why Django Sucks"" talk was given by a guy who very much loves Django.<p>I doubt that the Python community will ever spawn a web framework as <i>slick</i> as Rails. I think that the people who choose Python tend to have a very pragmatic, engineering bent and I don't think they value the slickness as much as the Rails community does. Keep in mind that Python is one of the few languages that Google writes code in.<p>Probably if Rails closed up shop today, more of the people that value that would move to python. Rails tends to draw what I would call the ""web 2.0 crowd"" who make very slick, very stylish websites. You can do that in Django too but you have to be willing to hire a designer. Ruby/Rails tend to see that as a core competitive advantage. Python has a much longer history and therefore tends to be more conservative. You can see that reflected in Django's release/deprecation schedule. Neither of those approaches are bad things. Diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks.<p>I think both of those languages/frameworks are better for each other although Python frameworks are better at borrowing ideas from Rails than the other way around. That's probably true of many frameworks though. They're not all that different, and I think you should probably learn and/or try out both.<p>I think both Django and Rails need to look out for the winner of the web battle in what I see as the up-and-coming language/framework: Javascript/Node.js<p>This is all, of course, just my opinion."
"And right after that:<p><i>The study exposed 20 ash trees to various radiation sources for a period of three months.

"His advice is definitely for small or medium form writing. Places where you have substantial blocks of text. If you are trying to style headings or a web application then some of the ideas will apply but you should seek advice specific to that. For instance, the ""give your text breathing room"" is always going to be correct, but how much room you need is different for a small chunk of text in a button vs a large block of text. The context that it is placed in also matters."
"Sure, the <i>intent</i> is good. However, would a hypothetical &#60;weight unit=grams&#62;5&#60;/weight&#62; be any better than ""5gm""? When I see a number followed by the letters 'gm' I know it's a weight in the units of grams. Google knows that too. Making it rely on the markup alone would actually make google dumber and making it understand both would make it more complex. It's better as 5gm.<p>The main advantage is to make it easier to extract using an xml-like api. But at what cost? ""5gm"" is way easier for people to type so it will always dominate in real text.<p>In my mind, markup is useful for adding context that is hard to extract from the text alone: things like groupings, context, delimitating chapters or articles, etc… I wouldn't use it to declare something to be a weight. You use it to add things that are unspoken otherwise. In the &#60;meter&#62; example, it actually lets you convey previously unknown things such as the min/max range.<p>Maybe if the whole world cared a lot about the differences between different kinds of weights and it was very hard to get from the context of the text, like &#60;catweight&#62; vs. &#60;dogweight&#62; or something, it would be worth marking up. Markup is a form of metadata."

"It starts with an invalid .jpg (literally a text file containing &quot;hello&quot;), and by trying over and over, changing random bytes and tracing the execution of the decoder program as it is fed the corrupted input, it will drill deeper and deeper into the program until it has gotten far enough that the input is actually a valid .jpg, without any human input.<p>Fuzzing like this is a very effective technique for finding (security) bugs in programs that parse input, because you will quickly end up with &quot;impossible&quot; input nobody thought to check for (but is close enough that it won&#x27;t be rejected outright), and whoops there&#x27;s your buffer overflow.<p>In this particular case, the fuzzer is going beyond just throwing random input, as it considers which changes to the input trigger new code paths in the target binary, and therefore should have a higher success rate in triggering bugs compared to just trying random stuff. And don&#x27;t forget, this will work with any type of program and file type, not just .jpgs and the djpeg binary."
"Even though Apple was right in the end, I think calling Apple &quot;arrogant&quot; is quite on the mark. It is they who denied opening up MobileSafari for 3rd party plugins (yet it supports 1st party plugins; in earlier versions you could even iterate the navigator.plugins property and see quicktime there). I remember seeing Adobe hinting heavily that they even had a working flash plugin (for jailbroken phones?) going internally. In fact, I think early Adobe Air applications targeting iOS shipped with an embedded flash player engine, until Apple started rejecting all applications &quot;not compiled with apple-gcc from objective-c&quot; and banning &quot;interpreted code&quot;, so Adobe even went as far as writing an AS3 LLVM compiler, so that newer Adobe Air applications were compiled down to native arm assembly with no flash runtime present.<p>See for example <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20130302154428&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;devnet&#x2F;logged_in&#x2F;abansod_iphone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20130302154428&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.c...</a><p>I bet the real reason for blocking flash player in Mobile Safari was to block all the flash based ad banners of the day.

"So far, I don't see a lot of people asking the really tough questions of what this non-competition for employees (especially engineers / developers) actually means.<p>* If some of the top companies are implicitly not competing for you (as an employee), it means your value as an asset is lowered. There is simply less desire for another company to lure you away with more money, better benefits, a more attractive project to work on, etc. Once you work at one of the companies ""on the list,"" none of the others will come knocking. Your value is also lowered in terms of being able to negotiate a better salary, for instance: HR (and perhaps your manager) knows that you do <i>not</i> have an offer from Yahoo or Google just waiting to whisk you away.<p>* The basic effect on general engineers' salaries is thus: the less it costs Google/MS to hire a Silicon Valley A-lister, the less incentive they will feel to look for bargains by hiring outside the circle of ""made men"". Thus they will hire fewer such relative-newcomers, at lower salaries. Thus there will be less upward pressure on non-Silicon-Valley-A-list salaries: fewer engineers will leave the broader pool for Silicon Valley and those that do will be receiving less money to do so, so the competitive pressures on the non-SV-A-list employers are weakened too. So less salary for SDEs broadly. This knock-on effect is likely minimal for junior ASP.NET bank programmers etc. but likely significant for hotter engineers at more high-powered dev/research/etc. workplaces throughout the US.<p>* Because certain kinds of employees' labour mobility is lowered, it means that access to engineers is somewhat more limited. Your company may not be able to get the rockstar/ninja/hip term of the week who already knows the valley, doesn't need to relocate, and just wants to pay off his SF condo more quickly. Inversely, you  may not want to compete for top graduates from places like Stanford with the 90k/100k first year salaries that Facebook and some others have been throwing around. This means you can either get second-tier native talent that may need relocating or that hasn't proven itself yet ... or you can play the H1 visa game and get a much cheaper foreign programmer who is contractually tied to your company, often fears for his immigrant status, and is thereby much less likely to leave your company for another one. This is a <i>bad</i> thing for US graduates or relatively inexperienced programmers, as it depresses their salaries, as well. In terms of the free market, I guess it's only a natural expression of international labour mobility.<p>* The lack of commentary on the above may be due to the current economic conditions and the ""thank $DEITY I still have a job"" attitude I've seen quite a bit. On the other hand, we got plenty of people on here with the kind of inside knowledge who would be able to tell us more on this subject."

"a) Yes it is, but when the never-endingness and unregulated internet is a thing, most people lack the self control to stop.<p>b) Nearly everybody I know wastes their time. I can’t find a single person who doesn’t go crazy on the internet. People are not to be trusted at the most basic level. They are duplicates of each other, consuming the easiest of material day in, day out, relaying it to each other, discussing it, embodying it. Questions like &quot;what book did you read last?&quot; and &quot;discover any new albums recently?&quot; do not exist in their universe. They have no concept of shame, only ego. If you asked them &quot;why don&#x27;t you read books?&quot; the answer will be &quot;because I&#x27;m not into books&quot;. The real reason is because they were distracted from the <i>good</i> things in life, to a point where the bar has been brought down so low that books become &quot;hard&quot; not &quot;fun&quot;. Math becomes hard, doing anything exerting effort beyond consumption becomes hard.<p>c) Those are GOOD forms of entertainment. Reading false news, engaging in internet shit throwing, all things that don’t actively increase your “human capital” are detrimental.<p>d) I mentioned my grandmother and those simple goals precisely because she will never realize them or strive for them if she had internet, which she won’t, which is the whole premise of the hopes in the first place (meaning her situation is so bad that if she could enjoy even those simple pleasures everything would have been worth it).<p>e) That is literally my exact point, the fact these communities exist is awful, it dupes the mind into believing you are connected. You aren’t.<p>I don’t trust people at all until they give me a reason. We are all fundamentally scum. The only reason we aren’t is because infrastructure and quality of life fill our voids enough where we don’t rely on killing one another. Take a mans meals away for 3 days and he’s a different person.<p>We are fundamentally weak, and to break that curse it takes a lifelong journey of dedication and struggle. If you picture this journey on a timeline, the internet becomes a little hole early on in the journey, a booby trap of sorts.<p>I realize the irony in posting this, but HN is the only website I go on besides reading documentation directly related to my job + sideprojects.<p>Do you see where I&#x27;m going with this? The net effect of the internet is negative, not positive. You may say that everything is sped up, and everything <i>is</i>, but the side effect of that is that it made us shittier humans, not to each other, but just at being ourselves. Being comfortable in our own skin."

I used both of them for binary exploitation in the security class I took at university: When utilizing buffer overflows, it&#x27;s important to get every byte at the right place of your payload. Sometimes, you also need to treat it as a string and that&#x27;s where ASCII comes in.<p>These are only two specific usecases. As I said, there are a lot more.

"They&#x27;ve certainly tried to against Microsoft but they failed. Microsoft and Apple were required by the government to license their standards related patents under reasonable terms to anyone before this Nortel patent portfolio buy was cleared.

I don&#x27;t even think this lawsuit contains patents related to standards, but it&#x27;s kind of a moot point because no company actually has a controlling interest in Rockstar.

"No. It&#x27;s correct.<p>I can say this having spent months in the laboratory to learn things which were already known. Who knew that precision quartz pressure gauges were called &#x27;manometers&#x27; in the late eighteen-hundreds?

"10 ug acceleration noise has large consequences in displacement error.<p>To get an estimate of the size of the effect, recall that for uniform acceleration, x(t) = 1/2 * a * t^2 . So, for 10 ug = 9.8e-5 m/s^2, this works out to ~600 m in an hour or 360 km in a day.<p>The real effect isn't quite this bad (it's random, not continuous, error), but it illustrates the point. Without an absolute reference for occasional comparison, inertial measurement requires exquisite precision and low-frequency stability in order to be useful for most positioning applications."

After almost 15 years of OO in C++ I jumped in the functional bandwagon (Haskell, Common Lisp etc)<p>I sure find (e (d (c (b a)))) easier to read.<p>Here's why:
In your first exemple ""a.b().c().d().e()"" you have to read up to the end to know what you are ""really"" doing, i.e. calling e() whereas in ""(e (...))"" up front I know the most important part: I'm calling function ""e"" on something.<p>The funniest part is even if you consider it from object perspective the message is more important at least to my view, even OO father Alan Kay thinks that too (see Computer Revolution has not happend).<p>As someone said before what we know condition us to what will be easier to read, to that I'd like to add that it is also ""how we undestand thing"". Sure I know C++/Java syntax better but the way I conceptualize OO is more through message than object...<p>Think about it this way do you like when you speak to someone and they start by a very lengthy introduction which you have no idea where it is leading to realise at the end that they were trying to sell you something?

"For anyone who's wondering:<p>Mode 7 was the SNES graphics mode that allowed for things like rotating and zooming a background layer - used for things like the track in Mario Kart and F-Zero, or the worldmap  in Final Fantasy 6 (while you're in the airship). The Scroll Register was used for scrolling in Mode 7.<p>H-Blank is the horizontal blanking period (and associated interrupt) - a time period between the drawing of scanlines on the screen (there's also V-blank, between frames). Changes made during H-Blank could make for some interesting effects - it was used for things like the circle that closes around Mario at the end of a level of Super Mario World: The rectangle draw routine is used, but the size of the rectangle is changed between scanlines, creating a circle. I'd imagine this was used for some of the wavy distortion effects in games like Chrono Trigger and Earthbound as well."

"""The public is outraged by the country’s wealthiest ducking out on the Gates-buffet event""<p>What differences can these companies make, and more importantly why do they have to make them?  There has to be a reason why you think these companies need to do something and I'm going to go with wanting other people to do what you think is right.  So when other people do right, you feel right which leads to you needing other people to do right in order to feel right (if you didn't need too this would all be a non-issue)  which makes you just as selfish as the people that don't want to spend the money in the first place."

"Last spec i saw of a dishwasher was 10 liters / wash. But i think that's pretty low because they were bragging with it.<p>Estimate how much you need by hand. Filling up the sink, 5-10L? And then rinsing it all afterwards, another 5 at least. Keep in mind that a dishwasher does about 4 meals  while you usually do one at a time when you do by hand."
"Digital media are failing, especially eBooks are, and it to me it feels like a huge cultural regression.<p>In the nineties, I digitized my CD collection and haven&#x27;t looked back. I did the same with my DVDs, and eventually I got (DRM-free or cracked) eBook versions of all books that were important to me. Doing away with all those physical storage objects felt <i>so liberating</i>, I can&#x27;t even describe it. Plus, I can have <i>all</i> my stuff with me wherever I go. I do enjoy reading on my iPad, too.<p>However, nobody I know of made this leap. Usually, older people like me do have some sort of ripped movie or eBook collection which they don&#x27;t use. Millennials, however, use physical media all the way, and even where they don&#x27;t they accept only DRM&#x27;ed, thoroughly walled gardens where you can rent stuff for a limited time and those companies only allow you to consume things in a very restrictive manner. They have <i>huge</i> DVD collections, they started printing out their photos again, they mostly <i>only</i> read paper-based books, they prefer streaming content via crappy proprietary channels, and I&#x27;m not even sure many of them would know how to copy a file if their life depended on it.<p>This feels like an immense failure to me, not only because I feel isolated in my content consumption habits, but also because we&#x27;ve somehow managed to move backwards for purely cultural reasons. It&#x27;s a loss of capability, and a loss of personal freedom and empowerment."
"That might be because as a lawyer you're biased to prefer form over intent. I'm sorry if this sounds nasty, it's not supposed to be though. People are different. GNU/Stallman goes to great lengths to describe where he is coming from so the reader can <i>understand</i> what the motivations behind his points are.<p>It's not supposed to be a watertight contract between two parties with opposing agendas who are trying to outmaneuver each other at a soulless semantics game. Instead, the rider is supposed to enable people who already have friendly intentions to understand (and interpolate!) what is important to their guest."
"I love my Mac Pro as a desktop solution, it allows me to attach all the screens I want and it has plenty of processing power. No other Apple product can do the same thing. I love my MacBook Pro as well, but it's just an extension of my desktop.<p>If the Mac Pro is really done, I'm moving on. I'm not bitter about this, because I had a good time as an Apple/Mac user for more than a decade. Coming from Linux, where multi-screening is still not at the level of Windows 2000, OS X provided a lot of the Unix comfort for me in a safer and much, much saner environment. It is, however, clear where Apple is going. Over the years, OS X users have been steadily disempowered. At some point in the future there will be a merge with iOS. Even though I still consider it my digital home, it feels to me like a declining platform.<p>The real question is indeed one of alternatives. I dread going back to Linux where I'll wrestle with configuration and braindead-by-design features once again. Nothing else has stepped up in the meantime, but maybe there will be something new one day. One can only hope."
"To stay within sci-fi lingo, wearing a detector bracer around your arm does make you a cyborg in the same way that having an iPhone in your pocket makes you a netrunner: it sort of does a comparable job, but at the end it's clearly not a part of your body and it's always going to be an external tool.<p>Humans carrying tools around are awesome, but they're not cyborgs. The prospect of having a real internal augmentation is that it seamlessly and naturally becomes a part of your body. Everything else is a little bit of a cargo cult, which is sort understandable considering the lack of progress we made so far into that area of research."
"He's right though about the small things being more disruptive. I'm more likely to integrate something small and conceptually well-scoped into my e-life than something big and monolithic that starts out with delusional mission statements like ""<i>will fundamentally change the way people $blablablah$ forever</i>""."

"<i>&gt; This means that to emulate the near one quadrillion connections in the human brain would take about $10B today</i><p>It&#x27;s important though to recognize that we&#x27;re still missing the appropriate software to run brains. Technically, BlueBrain can run a cat&#x27;s cortex today. Practically though just pumping up the number of neurons and connections does not yield general intelligence or consciousness, so BlueBrain cannot actually run a cat. Just as an even bigger supercluster cannot just run a human-like intelligence, even though the processing power might be there.<p>Furthermore, these are brute-force simulation ambitions. I would go out on a limb here and assert that we could actually run a human-level consciousness on much less hardware. Computers are very good at some things where our brains have to mount enormous infrastructure just in order to do OK."
"It could also be any other C6 ring. To me, it simply looks ""organic"" ;)"
That's funny but doesn't really make sense unless you manage to confuse consciousness with conscience.
"Maybe, but I think this is fundamentally different. Threesome Girl did not have a real motive against me. In fact, we were still drinking buddies when I learned what she had been doing this whole time. There was no love interest, no need for revenge, nothing to gain from doing this. Yet, she did. And even more puzzling: a lot of people helped her, she always had a lot of social support. She was quite brilliant at that. Maybe - maybe getting that support and recognition <i>was</i> the motive, but she already kinda <i>had</i> that before."
"I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve read that &quot;claptrap&quot; in its entirety, otherwise you&#x27;d have seen that I agree the undermining of those regimes is pretty much only achievable with education. If you&#x27;re from the US, that includes your regime as well, which I&#x27;m guessing is the point you&#x27;re disagreeing with.<p>If you really want to hear something controversial from me: I don&#x27;t think the problem is political at all, at the core it&#x27;s all about religious ignorance and religion-inspired values. Politics has a way of resolving itself, religion does not (except, again, through education hopefully).<p>Also I&#x27;d like to point out that I don&#x27;t write comments to get upvotes - although it&#x27;s nice to see people agreeing with me on stuff, I&#x27;m really here for the discourse. I fully expect my comments on this thread to turn gray shortly, to be honest."
"That&#x27;s true, and stealth is an interesting proposition. However, there are probably easier methods of preventing detection, such as not building a giant structure in the first place. Also, even if they manage to radiate away most of their waste heat, they&#x27;d have to assume eventual detection by an advanced civilization. Sure, with exponential effort you can always get infinitesimally closer to being virtually undetectable, but is that really feasible?<p>In the end, it&#x27;s certainly not impossible that a civilization would go to extreme lengths in order to hide its enormous artificial structures. But the real issue is: why would <i>all</i> civilizations hide in this way? And if it turns out they do <i>all</i> have elaborate stealth tech in operation, that means there must be an incomprehensibly huge threat out there - which in itself might be the answer to why nobody is calling us up."
"I don't think it's doable with today's technology, that's why laser-based retina projection is what everybody's working on right now. Achieving the same effect with a thin and semitransparent lens would require a lot of engineering to achieve tightly controllable photon angles and I imagine power/data transmission to the lens would also be an issue. Also, personally I would rather put on a pair of glasses than stick a piece of plastic directly into my eye."
"I come from Germany, the country that not only raised the bar when it comes to the industrialized killing of its population, it pretty much redefined the scope of evil achievable with cult-like dictatorships empowered by modern technology.<p>Euthanasia as used in the article is a form of newspeak introduced by the Nazis, a cynical redefinition that constitutes a corruption of the word&#x27;s original meaning.<p>As such, the word choice used here makes me just as uncomfortable as the concept itself. Originally, euthanasia (greek for &quot;good death&quot;) is a means of ending a life for which the only perspective left is suffering. In this sense, the word is still being used (appropriately) in conjunction with terminal illness where it does have a place as part of the right to self-determination exercised by patients who make the conscious and informed decision to end their lives in order to avoid this suffering.<p>I really wish people would stop taking hints from the Nazis when it comes to vocabulary, even if it&#x27;s on purpose. &quot;Death Coster&quot; or &quot;Ride of Doom&quot; would be perfectly sufficient."
"You&#x27;re not wrong. Our current ruling party has never been actually opposed to surveillance and is not really strong on privacy (to say the least). However, I think besides collecting cheap points with the German public, there is another factor behind this &quot;stomping of tiny feet&quot; as you call it:<p>Germany is somewhat of an economic powerhouse, but paradoxically radical innovation is culturally frowned-upon. This means that German tech is usually not ground-breaking but incrementally-improved-to-death (by heavyweight scientists with a lot of clout). Since there is reason to believe that a large part of all this spying is simply industrial espionage on behalf of big US companies, I believe the German government is afraid the local industry will quickly lose even more ground than it already has. Since innovation in this country doesn&#x27;t move very fast, the damage would be long-lasting and potentially devastating."
"I don't know anyone in here. I'm usually not submitting links, but among the very few I did submit, there was front page traction more often than not (if I remember correctly). So, yes, it's absolutely possible to ""make front page"" if that's your goal.<p>It's different when you're talking about your own project - I only submitted general news stuff. I understand that it can really sting if your project doesn't get picked up. There could be many reasons for it and, unless you're one of the top-ten superstars around here, I don't believe HN familiarity plays a big role in a story's success.<p>The main thing about the /newest section is that it is <i>very</i> low quality. It's dominated by spam and trash, so it's easy to overlook interesting stuff in there. Due to the high rate of new submissions a new entry doesn't last very long. Even good links vanish in record time if nobody sees them in the first few minutes.<p>In my opinion the main reason why good links do not get picked up is purely technical. Ideally, only accounts with good karma would be allowed to submit links to the queue and there should be harder limits on the number of things you can submit in a certain timeframe. That being said, HN's success rate is still pretty high regardless. Personally, when I see a ""Show HN:"" article I make it a point to vote it up (if the project isn't totally lame)."
"Again, I don&#x27;t think being a target for a higher level DSL is the motivation for this project.<p>But let&#x27;s talk about content instead: what are, in your opinion, the essential uses of goto in a language that has strong functional features and coroutines?"
"This isn't really a bug that originates from PHP's handling of types. If any floating point variable containing this number crashes the process, it doesn't matter whether the type declaration was implicit or not. Also, since you're using JSON as an example (why?), it's worth noting that type-safe languages require some sort of mapping for JSON fields as well, any of which could be FLOAT or DOUBLE and would thus be vulnerable. Until today there was no reason to assume the floating point types weren't safe, either. Finally, it has already been pointed out that the problem is caused by a GCC optimization bug, so the implication is that any recent GCC-compiled executable may be vulnerable to erratic behavior upon encountering this number."
"Surveillance cams are part of the setup ;) They&#x27;re old, modified Android phones, actually."
"This sounds very alien to me. Only one of the factors I listed could possibly be fixed by choosing the right distro, so I must attribute the rest of your success story to extreme culture differences. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: it&#x27;s nice to hear this is working for you, but that outcome is nowhere near a realistic expectation where I live.<p><i>&gt; Everything is &quot;easy&quot; but it&#x27;ll cost you $30 to buy an app to fix your mouse and you gain no useful knowledge through the experience.</i><p>While I don&#x27;t think paying for software is necessarily a deal breaker, I have never come across a situation where buying an app for $30 was necessary to &quot;fix the mouse&quot;. What was wrong with it? I agree that just using an external tool doesn&#x27;t give you knowledge, but strictly speaking, fiddling with an arbitrarily designed config file doesn&#x27;t grant you any meaningful knowledge either beyond the single program it was intended to run on. For example, I would rate the knowledge of how to edit an X11 config manually as functionally equivalent to knowing how to install a GUI tool that manages your display."
"It's a good idea but the Mini isn't really in the same category as far as processing power and memory capacity go. And this extension chassis is ridiculously expensive for no reason. Still, it's a good alternative if/when the Pro goes out."
"1 - Absolutely, there is a huge list of things I would have done differently - and there's a huge list of failure modes I now know how to look for. The most obvious thing: I would never again borrow money personally to invest in a failing business, that was just unspeakably arrogant and stupid. But there are also a lot of operational and technical details that I would never screw up like this again.<p>2 - I took a job pretty much immediately. I consolidated my debt into a more manageable package, I'm still paying it off though (it's really huge). The alternative would have been declaring personal bankruptcy, which in hindsight might have been a much better move, but at least I am taking responsibility this way.<p>I did bounce back in a sense that my life is in order and I'm financially sound again. I have a good job (yes, my crisis management experience paid off), I travel a lot on business, I have a nice car. But it's not the same as succeeding with your own company. On the other hand, my job has taught me several key things I should have known when I did the startup, so I'm really thankful for the opportunities I got.<p>I'm pretty sure I'll try this again, in a safer and saner environment. It will definitely involve less dreams and more math."

"Yeah but there&#x27;s the socialization aspect.  In that my kids are pretty good at getting into meaningless sibling arguments with each other in real life, and also in minecraft.  True that there is superficially no downside to beating each other up in minecraft, but may as well try to civilize them a bit as if we&#x27;re in real life.  Or learning when dad says if you do that the wrong way its going to hurt, is an easier lesson to learn the hard way in minecraft than on a bicycle or whatever, so why not teach it in minecraft where they won&#x27;t get physically hurt by falling into minecraft lava or off a minecraft building."
Or just the average meth head doing smash and grabs.
"I googled it and read the official Harvard application instructions, which specify the application fee is $75 although you can ask them to waive the fee.  It didn't specify the odds of them granting the fee waiver (0%?  100%?) nor did it specify waiving would have no effect on your application (The same document specifically claimed in writing that the inability to schedule an interview has no negative effect on your application, but no such language WRT a fee waiver request).  Also the risk was not specified, like if they deny and bill you will collections go after you or ""merely"" toss out your app for non-payment or ...  The problem is not so much $75, as the general cultural advice to apply to 10 other schools just in case which turns it into a $750 problem for a kid.<p>They also want a rather remarkable amount of (expensive) paperwork sent to them.  Everything about the SAT costs money, $50 for the basic test, $11 to send the scores to a school (seriously, $11?  In 2013 it costs $11 to shove some digits somewhere?) although all is peppered with ""fee waiver available"".<p>Aside from the cost investment, there is also the time investment problem.  As per above if you decide you can't afford it, and they want a fairly large amount of work done to apply, even if even more paperwork could result in it being free, well, why bother?"
"Less, not more.<p>Too close and the pixels are going to be &quot;big&quot; and too far away and the pixels are going to be invisible.<p>For example, at 15 feet away the high res would be a waste of money for that screen size, you can&#x27;t see better than 480 lines at that range.<p>Extending my arm, I seem to be around 2.5 feet from this screen.  Doing the math, higher that 4K at 40 inch screen would be visibly noticeable although its kind of borderline, so 4K should be good enough."
"&quot;once I have spare money and time&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been telling myself that for decades and never quite had both at the same time.  Often a great excess of one or the other.  By the time I finally have both, I&#x27;ll probably fail my medical with my luck.  I did do ground school + a bit more on my own, and I&#x27;ve got a couple hours in the air with an instructor.  I do some semi-serious sim flying for fun, mostly the X-Plane.  If I ever get serious I&#x27;ll already be pretty good at navigation, flight planning, reading approach plates, E6B use, METAR decoding, NOTAM decoding, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a remarkable number of free electronic E6B apps for most phones.  And some paid ones that are marginally better.  I find my tablet to be quite helpful when &quot;flying&quot; although I also use old fashioned mechanical E6B... Figure $10 for a paper one that&#x27;ll last &quot;awhile&quot; and $30 for a lifetime metal one.<p>The frontier of flight sims right now is no one does NOTAM simulation.  Why not shut down some ground stuff occasionally, just like you can shut down aircraft systems and screw around with weather?  It may be there&#x27;s a sim out there that does this that I don&#x27;t know about."

"That shows a little problem, in that its probably not terribly difficult to find a &quot;real employer&quot; or some contract work paying over $16&#x2F;hr 40 hrs&#x2F;wk and then do something even cooler than the startup during your 40 hours &quot;off&quot;.<p>If the startup is only looking for $7&#x2F;hr caliber of employee, if you&#x27;re worried about them making it big and missing out, get a &quot;real&quot; $30&#x2F;hr job 40 hrs a week and out of that income hire a $7&#x2F;hr noob to keep the startup entertained while you&#x27;re at your real job.

"As short as possible, people don&#x27;t get undeserved hate, but self promotional brands get the burning hate of 10000 suns.<p>Some of those self promotional brands are multinational megacorps and when you divide the internet hate machine between prez, CEO as you list, plus board members, major shareholder investors, 10 thousand dealership owners, 10 thousand service dept managers, probably 100 thousand salespeople, the average &quot;GM dude&quot; gets a middle finger from the internet hate machine about once every decade and just kinda brushes it off.  When the self promotional brand is one woman as the face of social justice warriors (generally speaking, not the specific lady from the article, although we know who I&#x27;m talking about), she&#x27;s going to take the full impact square on full force no protection.

She, as a basically nice person, doesn&#x27;t deserve it at all, but brands will be brands and culturally we think its OK to hit a brand that hard.  And she wants to be a brand, so the painful result is not exactly surprising when it happens...<p>You wanna be as big as GM you better be able to take a GM sized punch.  Nobody in the general public understands the difference between her financial statements and GMs statements, they just know her and GM are both on twitter, and we all know what twitter is for, so the guy who was screaming at GM for taking .gov bailout tax money last night is going to be on her case tonight, with 10 million of his &quot;friends&quot; and she&#x27;s not going to like it.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t consider ... bashing ... a net good&quot;<p>Any mistake in my summarization of your position is my own.  Given that disclaimer, the sound you just heard was every clickbait journalist and sports writer and PR dude in the world just disagreeing with you.<p>Members of the general public making an emotional connection with a brand is idealized because optimistic people assume it&#x27;ll be like a laughter filled life long infatuation of a love affair right out of a sappy hollywood romantic comedy movie, forgetting that too many intense human emotional relationships end in hatred, murder, insanity, beatings.  Not that many, thankfully, but enough to be a problem when you scale it to a 7 billion person marriage.  If you use techniques that give people an emotional response to a brand, you might not like that response...  And if you&#x27;re GM sized you don&#x27;t care, but if you&#x27;re one human female sized that punch is going to sting a bit.<p>(Edited to add, think of social media as a multiplier.  You can have the force of a billion dollar brand, if you&#x27;re lucky and play it well.  The bad news is if you don&#x27;t play it well, you WILL have to be able to take a punch like a billion dollar brand.  And that&#x27;ll hurt if it all lands on just you.  And the Billion Dollar Brands like it that way, who needs competition from the little people?)"
"No, silence is vital for hunting.  Also if a possible mate or friend is talking to you, its not exactly helpful to be daydreaming about growing seeds or moon phases.  If you&#x27;re doing hard manual labor while visualizing a simpler way to do it, you&#x27;re probably breathing too hard to talk.<p>I will give you credit that sometimes ancient humans probably had to think pretty hard while talking.  Planning a hunt.  Trying to organize sleeping arrangements.  Primitive military operation planning beyond the level of a crude bar fight (so they basically stole one of our proto-cows, can we take them and how?)<p>(I should edit this to remove the second paragraph, upon contemplation, that&#x27;s not thinking while talking, thats concentrating hard on listening to the other person in order to plan how to manipulate them, which is at cross purposes to writing great code or daydreaming as the original topic...

"I see truth in what you write.<p>However, given that I can&#x27;t see a movie for less than $15, that $1.5B represents only 100M views, and if you theorize that only 1B of the world population is wealthy enough to occasionally blow $15 to watch a movie, that implies 90% of the population is uninterested in VFX demo reels, which isn&#x27;t all that dramatically different from my engineering estimate, especially given we could cherry pick examples to &quot;prove&quot; either your claim or mine, or play games with $ per unit time to reach either conclusion.<p>I completely agree that $1.5B is important business, yet it makes my point that appealing to a narrowcasted local maxima of VFX fans also simultaneously means perhaps 90% of the population will be uninterested.  And the point I&#x27;m trying to make isn&#x27;t that 10% of the population is irrelevant, but if someone could crack the code and disrupt the industry and instead of narrowcasting, make something of broad appeal that perhaps half the population would be interested in, that mysterious idea would be worth about $7.5B which is actually pretty good revenue for a startup.  But it&#x27;ll never happen if the entrenched oligopoly isn&#x27;t disrupted.<p>I honestly have no idea how to exploit the market, but &quot;obviously&quot; there&#x27;s a huge under served market with possibly staggering revenue, for some future startup that can figure out how to make movies that appeal to more than about 10% of the population.  Piles of money are sitting out there, waiting to be harvested...<p>There are similar analogies and financials with pop music.  Entrenched industries have pretty much figured out how to sell simple mass produced formulaic music to each generation&#x27;s (each years?) teens.  There seems no biological or psychological reason a better industry competitor couldn&#x27;t sell 3 to 7 times as much if they could appeal to more than young kids.  Eventually someone will crack that startup opportunity and make mid nine figures.<p>Finally ditto, kind of, with sports.  &quot;Everybody is a baseball fan&quot; but only about 5% of the population actually watches the world series.  If you take existing advertising revenue and multiply it by a fraction representing some magic startup pixie dust that gets maybe 50% of the population to watch, that&#x27;s some serious ad revenue money; in fact its &quot;football&quot; type money, LOL, which is a whole nother topic."

Once its removed and shipped out, its gone, and all the money in the world isn&#x27;t going to make shippable product appear out of thin air.<p>You&#x27;re talking about two different scales.  MX will never pump more oil than they did at peak a long time ago.  That doesn&#x27;t mean fat stacks of cash can&#x27;t be made on the downslope or political intrigue can&#x27;t be useful.  For example, petroleum revenue declines are already causing a financial &#x2F; political crisis in MX so transferring the blame from PEMEX to &quot;vague groups of rich foreigners&quot; is a wise political move as its always better for a local to blame the foreigners than the other locals.  So the Cantarell tank is almost empty, almost entirely pumped out; better to blame Exxon than the CEO of PEMEX, at least if you&#x27;re the leader of MX, at least on paper (the actual guys running MX are the drug gang leaders, which is a whole nother topic... take away petroleum revenues and legalize weed in the USA at the same time and MX would make Somalia look rich which is a crisis not just for MX but their neighbor to the north, which as a real political issue is why the USA will never legalize weed until long after the oil downslope is all resolved in MX... intentionally collapsing a neighboring country with a completely permeable land border is almost as dumb as the idea of the war on some drugs)"
"&quot;One benefit of such reactors is the relatively short life of its waste products, which would be in the hundreds of years as opposed to millions of years for existing nuclear reactors.&quot;<p>This line in the wikipedia is outright false.  There&#x27;s no way for a fissioning nucleus to magically know if the neutron that hit it came from an accelerator or another fissioning U atom.  Neutron&#x27;s can&#x27;t be spray painted green to greenwash &#x2F; eco brand them to magically make them better than non-greenwashed neutrons.<p>The rest of the article is more or less true.  It misses the two most important uses of accelerator driven reactors.  The first is even if you can&#x27;t generate primary energy and its a net energy sink, you can still transmute elements.  So if nasa needs more of specific Pu isotopes for a RTG, you can incredibly slowly create it by burning an enormous quantity of coal without having an actual reactor.  Or you could make a plant that overall eats (lots of) electricity and squirts out americium for smoke detectors.  The second use is obviously research, you now have a magic machine that eats electricity and while it eats electricity it creates an environment very much like the inside of a real reactor, without the costs and size and weight and security concerns of a normal reactor.  Not exactly the same but probably good enough for short term materials science or other fooling around."

"&gt; India’s patrilineal traditions dictate that the eldest son care for his parents in old age and inherit property, while the dowries paid to marry off daughters can be expensive.

"This will actually make cars handle worse unless it's redesigned in one of two non-trivial ways. The problem is camber: the side-to-side tilt of the wheel and tire. Bringing the top of the wheel closer to the center of the car is called ""negative camber"" while the opposite is ""positive camber"". Most modern cars have a little bit of negative camber, which increases as the suspension is compressed. The relationship of compression to camber is called the ""camber curve"".<p>When the tire is being deformed by cornering forces, negative camber helps more of the tire stay in contact with the road. When traveling in a straight line, negative camber reduces the tire's contact with the road and increases tire wear. The reduced contact is visible on the left rear tire in the fourth photo.<p>One solution is to design a suspension with a very fast camber curve and allow minimal compression when cornering. This is similar to what most sports cars already do, and has a couple problems of its own. Such a suspension design is more limited in the distance the wheel can travel upward  and has somewhat less traction on bumpy surfaces.<p>Another solution is to have a separate motor to adjust camber. That's expensive and heavy, but would probably work pretty well."

Comparing to my grandmother's Buick Roadmaster, I'll agree with you.<p>Again, I'm not saying modern cars aren't better. I'm saying the difference in active safety is not as big as the difference in passive safety, and I'm wondering why that is. Today's best handling cars are much better than the best cars of decades ago, but the average isn't nearly so improved."

After googling around, turns out it was a problem with ltmain.sh - which ./bootstrap creates.  It checks to see if the OS is Darwin, and then runs glibtoolize instead of libtoolize (Apple includes glibtoolize it seems, its in my /usr/bin).  However glibtoolize isn't generating the correct file for some reason.  Not sure why this is.  I've got autoconf/automake/libtool installed from a past project so I used those instead of figuring out exactly what was wrong.<p>To get FAAC to compile, I ran ""aclocal -I .; autoheader; libtoolize --automake; automake --add-missing; autoconf"" manually instead.  This one worked properly and was able to install.<p>FAAD was had more wrong then just glibtoolize generating a wrong file. It would generate a configure file, however it wasn't complete.  The README here didn't help install for OS X, and the only INSTALL file i could find was for the xmms plugin.  So I read the *nix README. Which said to run autoreconf -vif first.  That brought up:<p><pre><code>  /usr/local/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am: am__fastdepCXX does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
  /usr/local/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am:   The usual way to define `am__fastdepCXX' is to add `AC_PROG_CXX'
  /usr/local/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am:   to `configure.in' and run `aclocal' and `autoconf' again.
</code></pre>
To fix this, open up configure.in and find the only mention of AC_PROG_CXX.  Change that line from ""dnl AC_PROG_CXX"" to just ""AC_PROG_CXX""  Then rerun ""aclocal -I .; autoheader; libtoolize --automake; automake --add-missing; autoconf"" instead of relying on ./boostrap.  Then it compiled correctly for me.<p>If anyone wants, I could just toss together a quick .pkg that would install faac 1.26 and faad 2.61.  lame (3.98) and ffmpeg's (latest svn, 14469) installs were straightforward enough and didn't have issues so those shouldn't need a pkg. Though ffmpeg was missing a ton of libraries.  Suppose thats what I get (along with fixing problems like the one above) for not using fink or macports."

"Having been there and back again I laugh at the elitism on this page now.<p>""Arch doesn't offer such a facility as it goes against TheArchWay. SUSE, therefore, is widely regarded as more appropriate for less-experienced users, or those who want a more GUI-driven environment, autoconfiguration and expected functionality out of the box. ""<p>Such an elegant way of saying SUSE IS 4 teh noobz and i use arch kuz i'm hardcore.<p>Having been there and back again I find myself on FC, because it's stable. I know that I can update the fucking thing whenever, or not even update for a year and it won't fuck up my install. Unlike Arch which if you don't update for 1-3 month's you're guaranteed a fuckup because you missed 2 critical updates and there's no way to get them unless you feel like manually finding the actual packages and installing them.<p>That page misses an important aspect, Arch sucks for stability, programming, and people who hate typing pacman -Syu every damn day. Arguably stability and programming are finer points for the SUSE distro because, it's got a plethora of development packages which are installable at various versions (yast/zypper is a bit of a bitch about this though), as well as the fact that SUSE handles concurrent versions way better than Arch.<p>""Fedora has a scheduled release cycle. Arch is a rolling-release system. The Arch design approach is geared more toward lightweight elegance and minimalism rather than automation/autoconfiguration.""<p>I also love this perl of wisdom, no it's not. I can get a minimal FC11 install, or I can install CentOS and get the same damn minimalism and elegance and lightweightness. How do you judge how lightweight a distro is? I can remove every component from fedora and suse. I don't need their gui tools installed, nor do I need their commandline-ncurses tools installed. If Fedora decided to support kmod then it'd have more modular packages than Arch, so what is this mythical lightweightness? Is Gentoo more light weight than Arch? Or Is the opposite true, because Gentoo's ebuild directory can span anywhere from 700mb (generous) to 2 gb.<p>Here's the bottom line, most OS comparison is FUD. In most distros moving the ease of use up just makes the window of use bigger (a more inclusive user base, ie people who only use the gui or people who only use the cli or a mix).<p>Also I enjoyed the fact that Arch pretty much says, we break patent law freely because we don't have a backing company who one can get money out of with a lawsuit:<p>""Fedora famously doesn't attempt to support the MP3 media format due to perceived patent issues. Arch is more lenient in its disposition toward MP3 and other media.""<p>Maybe I'm jaded from all the ""ZOMG ARCH LINUX"" crap on /r/linux, but Arch isn't as 'teh awesome' as people make it out to be. In fact when you use x64-bit distro all the speed ups (some more than others) that Arch used to tout with i686 packages disappear."

"Many of the points are good. I believe one point is true about advice in general: ""They confuse pattern matching with knowledge"", which I think is often very true for advice from professors, parents, friends, etc. 
A pattern failed a few times might provide insight, but it must be presented in that perspective, rather than using it to draw general and strong conclusions. Someone/something might have failed in spite of the pattern rather than because of it."

"The benefit of the IRL approach is that it gives you an immediate opportunity to show positive qualities which don't always carry over very well into a dating website profile -- and you can leverage any physical attraction right off the bat.<p>See, the thing about dating sites is: women are in demand, men are not.  When you're in a superior bargaining position, it's a lot easier to be picky.  So women don't give a second thought about discarding profiles for even the most superficial reasons.

"Sandboxing is a good idea, but also done poorly on every platform I&#x27;m familiar with.<p>What I want as a user:<p>I want to be able to see -- for each app -- exactly what permissions it requests and what permissions I have given it. I want them to be in plain language, presented in a way that is comprehensible to non-technical people but also to developers &#x2F; power users. I want to be able to toggle permissions that are not required. (Obviously if an app requires a permission I don&#x27;t want to give it, I have to just uninstall it.)<p>I also want to be able to see exactly what each app is doing. What it&#x27;s talking to on the network would be high on that list, along with what files it&#x27;s accessing or trying to access, etc. Obviously any privacy-invasive feature like location information is very high on such a list of things I want visibility into.<p>There could be &quot;permission motifs&quot; or &quot;templates&quot; to make things easier to understand. For example, a &quot;productivity app&quot; template might only give file access to Documents and network access to a limited set of endpoints and iCloud. A &quot;peer to peer networking app&quot; though might require promiscuous network access. A &quot;hardware interface&quot; might require kernel module permission (which would have a warning to the effect that this confers full administrative rights, because it does). A &quot;VPN&quot; might require the ability to open virtual network (tun) ports. And so on...<p>The app should be required to include descriptive text explaining why it needs each requested permission.<p>Finally, as a user I want some kind of summary display that shows the cumulative &quot;exposed surface area&quot; of my machine. What permissions have I granted where?<p>I also want convenient installs <i>and uninstalls</i>. By default I want automatic (secure, signature checked) updates, but I want the ability to turn that off if I desire. I want to be able to manage which certificates or CAs are trusted to install apps -- which would include self-signed apps. (Self-signed is superior to unsigned in every way, since it allows secure updates once I approve the self-signature.)<p>What I want as a developer:<p>I want to be able to request permissions that are as deep as are necessary to provide the functionality my users want. In a few cases (network stuff, virtualization, certain kinds of hardware support) this may even require a kernel module, but most of the time nothing that far-reaching is needed.<p>The thing is -- desktops&#x2F;laptops are &quot;power&quot; machines. You <i>do</i> need to be able to do powerful and OS-extending things on them. But I want a security model where I can say precisely which apps I trust with those kinds of permissions. I don&#x27;t want grant-by-default and I don&#x27;t want total prohibition.<p>Microsoft actually tried to deliver something like that a few times, but failed. IMHO their failure is completely in execution. They offered a terrible UI and user experience where you kept getting pestered with security-related popups that didn&#x27;t actually explain what was going on.

"&quot;In case you doubt the appeal of authoritarianism just go look at the popularity of Stalin in Russia, or the readership of the Daily Mail in the UK, or the overwhelming political support for the NSA &#x2F; the PATRIOT Act. Lots and lots of people want to live in a highly authoritarian society and it&#x27;s worth reflecting on why that is, and whether those people have valid reasons.&quot;<p>This is a really salient point and one that comes off as heresy to the standard conspiracy-esque narrative. The reality is that to some extent our slide into authoritarianism is <i>democratic</i>.<p>Look at the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; -- they got a little democracy and mostly elected totalitarian theocrats. In that case many people want totalitarian enforcement of social norms.<p>Another place you can see a strong preference for authoritarianism is at a local community level. Many people prefer communities with strong zoning regulations, regulations on the appearance of buildings, and (often indirect) mechanisms for excluding &#x27;undesirable&#x27; residents. Without those things you get sprawling, ugly, and sometimes crime-ridden places that just don&#x27;t feel safe and are not aesthetically appealing.<p>Yet another is the clear preference many people have for authoritarian computing platforms like iOS. It&#x27;s the most restricted platform in the history of computing, yet it offers superior user experience and a lack of malware precisely for that reason. The fact is that there&#x27;s classes of problems that can be easily and simply solved by authoritarianism that are not easily addressed in a freer society."

"That is the standard conservative incrementalist position about systems. I think it&#x27;s a denial of the efficacy of conceptual thought.<p>It often stems from an analogy to biological evolution, but evolution is a geological-timescale process that occurs over aeons. To use it as a guide to cultural, social, and engineering progress is the naturalistic fallacy not to mention a bit of a category error.<p>That being said -- I do consider the challenging of the &quot;crappy old OS + virtualization&quot; paradigm unlikely due to the lack of a strong financial incentive to do the work. The amount of work required is <i>waaaaay</i> beyond amateur open source hacker thresholds.<p>It&#x27;s possible that this lack of a financial incentive betrays a lack of overall value incentive. Maybe containerization + virtualization, while ugly and ham-fisted, is &quot;good enough&quot; and a more elegant approach just wouldn&#x27;t have enough &quot;win&quot; to it. A similar situation exists with languages like D, Go, and Rust vs C++. They&#x27;re better, but they&#x27;re probably not better enough to displace the incumbent. Peter Thiel&#x27;s rule on competition (from the incredible book Zero to One) is that an upstart alternative usually has to be 10X better to &quot;disrupt&quot; an established market. I can&#x27;t imagine a polished-up Plan9-ish OS being 10X better than Linux+Docker+KVM on important metrics. A new OS would have to be 10X as productive to program, 10X less time consuming to admin, 10X more efficient at the use of hardware, 10X more secure, or some combination thereof that amounts to a 10X win."

The ""anti-photon"" is not a real particle, and does not need to find another photon to annihilate with. It's more of a concept of energy, what it represents is missing energy, which needs to be provided in order for the partner (the regular photon to exist).<p>The ""missing/extra"" energy pair can exist only for a short time, below the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. If, in some way, you disrupt the annihilation of missing and extra energy, the particles would not appear in the first place (that's that out of order business I was talking about). But since the experiment provided energy, the particles can appear, and then be split, and the ""anti-photon"" uses the energy of the experiment to not exist.<p>You have probably heard of the momentum/location uncertainty pair - but there is another: it's time/energy. So the more exactly you know how much energy there is, the less you know about when it existed - that's why the particle can have this out of order behavior - time itself is not properly defined for it."

"<i>You seem to be claiming that if artificial intelligence does not exist at a human level, that it therefore does not exist at any level.</i><p>Right now it doesn't - not at any level. There are no AI's that can self-program. So it's hardly a strawman argument. There are some that can learn the specifics of pre-programed concepts, but none that can self learn a new concept. That is something that most animals can do, but computers are not even close.<p>Yes, human olfactory nodes do not have any intelligence at all - but not because ""they are not at the level of current human general-intelligence"", but because they can only do the single function they were created to do, and can not learn anything else.<p>There are lines in intelligence - it's not a continuum. The first line, to use your example, is being able to recognize any human face after being programmed with a sample of human faces. The second line is to be able to recognize the concept of face of a different species, i.e. the concept of the ""front"" of a creature.<p>AI has not even reached the second line.<p>A next major line (I'm sure there are others before that) is being able to learn to self-program. This means: use only the IO of the program, and using that teach it something new, without sending any commands that change it's programming. I don't think AI will ever reach this, even though animals can do it to some degree.<p>A further line is being able to create something new, not simply respond to requests. This does not mean a refinement of an existing technique, but something totally new. Not even all humans actually do this, it's in the realm of genius.<p>I skipped the line separating animals from humans. But it is a line, it's not a matter of degree - there is a jump from non-sapient to sapient.<p>Even the most retarded human is noticeably different from the smartest animal."

The authors found that although the antidepressants were statistically superior to placebo they did not exceed the NICE criteria for a 'clinically significant' effect. In particular they found that the effect size was very small for moderate depression but increased with severity reaching 'clinical significance' for very severe depression. The relationship between severity and efficacy was attributed to a reduction of the placebo effect in severely depressed patients, rather than an increase in the effect of the medication.""<p>(Especially note the last sentence.)<p>Please don't understand this in reverse and assume people should/can do nothing.

"Agreed, one should know the strengths of your language, and avoid the pitfalls. Every language has its share of both. But the effort, I suppose, is to increase the surface area of the strengths.<p>So one of the claims of Julia is that you write code in the most natural manner, and depend on the compiler to make it fast. So, for example, the claim is that adding the optional type parameters do not necessarily make your code faster... type inference is good enough in most cases (there are obvious counterexamples, eg with global variables, but its true in the majority of cases). Also, unlike for eg. Matlab or R, vectorising your code does not necessarily produce performance gains, arrays are good enough. One of the side effects is that the standard library is implemented in the language itself, and thus extending built-in types is a breeze.<p>Therefore, I think its a very interesting effort in itself. Whether it is good enough to displace any other language is a completely separate issue. As said below, the base of useful libraries in languages such as R is phenomenal. But that should not, I think, preclude admiring a very interesting new language, for the possibilities that it hints at, if only as a highly engaging mental activity.<p>Personally, and subjectively, I think the combination of the above, and multiple dispatch, causes the language to have a highly pleasing sense of elegance."

It doesn't really sound like it.  First he urges a boy to become skilled in war, then he pictures the boy's fiancee begging him not to fight against the enemy's star fighter -- a lion of a warrior.  Then the poet says, ""it is sweet and fitting to die on behalf of one's country,"" and goes on the describe the heroic qualities of personified Virtue in face of opposition.<p>Horace did claim to have himself thrown away his shield and fled from battle when in the service of the republican cause (the side of Brutus) after the death of Caesar.  But he's also picking up on a theme used by early Greek poets, like Alcaeus, so it's questionable how much of this confession is literary trope and how much is historical evidence.  Furthermore, Horace had been fighting on the losing side, and he later found it necessary to receive pardon from the victor Octavian (aka Augustus), so better to sound like he supported the republicans only half-heartedly.  On the other hand, it might well still be true that he ditched his shield and ran.<p>The poem dates from after his military experience, and belongs to a collection of poems called the 'Roman Odes' that celebrate Rome and the emperor Augustus.<p>I think that's mostly correct, but it's been a while since I studied these things."

"Intellij has a few features that I would have a hard time living without. Code inspection is probably the number one feature that is pretty amazing. You can configure it to check everything from warning about null pointers to unused variables to questionable practices (like an assignment in a conditional). When you have a green light, you can be reasonably sure that the code is clean from most basic problems. The autocomplete is the best I've seen in any IDE, and it allows matches on CamelCase by just typing the capital letters and brings up choices based on type inference. The version control integration is also pretty amazing; I think they could sell the change management and merging portion as a stand alone tool that would do really well on its own. Overall, IntelliJ lets me get into a flow with programming by making a lot of the warts of Java melt away. Sometimes it feels like it's almost writing the code for you and you are just giving it some direction. I know that some of these features have been implemented in Eclipse, but the way they all integrate so seamlessly makes IntelliJ a fun environment to code in. I miss these features in other languages that don't have an advanced IDE."

Return types can't always be deduced since they can be ambiguous - imagine an if statement where one branch returns a float and the other returns a double.

"A lot of economists and market participants believe that these measure not only fail to mitigate falling asset prices but make them worse. For instance, short selling often makes matters worse:<p>&gt;In 2008, U.S. regulators banned the short-selling of financial stocks, fearing that the practice was helping to drive the steep drop in stock prices during the crisis. However, a new look at the effects of such restrictions challenges the notion that short sales exacerbate market downturns in this way. The 2008 ban on short sales failed to slow the decline in the price of financial stocks; in fact, prices fell markedly over the two weeks in which the ban was in effect and stabilized once it was lifted. Similarly, following the downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating in 2011—another notable period of market stress—stocks subject to short-selling restrictions performed worse than stocks free of such restraints.

"Of course people do.  I&#x27;m sure there are apps that aggregate that type of at a for you in one easy search.  Not just for dating, but for employment, renting and other things as well.<p>To the OP though - if you have a serious criminal record you&#x27;re going to have to disclose that up front.  That&#x27;s the way it is these days, and as the majority of people don&#x27;t have a criminal record at all, it&#x27;s not going to change.  You can hardly blame them, as past behaviour is an excellent guide to future behaviour."
"No, it died just before the last election in August 2010.  Officially it's 'on hold', but practically, it is dead.<p>How?  A lot of pressure put on a lot of politicians in the run-up to the last federal election, which promised to be very close (and was actually one of the closest in history).<p>You obviously have to pressure whomever holds the majority, but you've got to let the other side know about it as well.<p>So Australia is filter-free for the foreseeable future - it's become a 'dead issue' that politicians aren't willing to spend political capital on.<p>US Folks should take this as a bright data point that these battles can be won, but it will take a lot of effort.<p>Personally it's something that Tea Party and OWS types could get together on, because it sucks for everyone.  That's what happened in Australia - they took heat from both 'sides' of politics and it got dumped (sorry, <i>postponed</i>)"
"The worst case scenarios for c02 emissions are so full of unknown and unknowable variables they are barely more useful than SETI work. They're also over a timeframe beyond everyone here's lifetime.  The models have a lot of assumptions in them, and cover variations of the order of 3-400%.  It's just not useful information, apart from selling magazines and newspapers.  You cannot do anything with vague forecasts from c02 research, apart from scare people.<p>Conversely, we know exactly what happens when you breathe too many particulates.  We know how to fix the problem.  You don't even need to redistribute income globally to do anything about it.<p>Cigarette smoke is literally a drop in the ocean from large scale emissions like diesel engines, coal stacks, car exhausts and the like.<p>Clean air and water is priority no 1 for all humans.  You don't need food until the first two are taken care of."
"The discussion about the costs of car travel are interesting -particularly in light of some of the topics circulating recently about how the private car is a terrible model.<p>It&#x27;s not so much that the cost of a car is so cheap - cars do cost us significant chunks of income - it&#x27;s the fact that the value (or cost&#x2F;benefit, if you want to get technical) is so high.<p>Time is precious to everyone with a busy life.  Cars save time, above and beyond their cost to maintain.  Even if you are stuck in traffic and can&#x27;t believe you are wasting your time, you&#x27;re still saving time compared to the guy who had to wait for a bus, hail a cab or organise a rideshare and is still stuck in traffic.<p>Show me someone who doesn&#x27;t need&#x2F;want a car, and I&#x27;ll show you someone who either has billions&#x2F;trillions worth of infrastructure at their door, or someone who doesn&#x27;t value their time highly.<p>Anyway, thanks for sharing.  The decision to close down before the cash ran out is certainly brave and should be encouraged.  Posting the lessons learned is even better."
"Because its a fact that we cannot, with current technology, support 7 billion people living a modern lifestyle. We simply can&#x27;t produce enough energy in a clean enough fashion to attempt anything of the sort.<p>Because technology is a force multiplier and will pay larger dividends than charitable endeavors.<p>Because <i>“On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.”</i> -  Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club<p>*Keep in mind I&#x27;m making this statement as if we&#x27;re only able to pursue one course of action (charity or technology). In reality we should, and are, pursue both solutions at once."
"What you linked to is an animation of a Ted talk by Daniel Pink.  This in turn comes out of his book Drive.  The thesis is that a higher paycheck will not spur greater creativity; it says nothing about what will spur one to move laterally to a company.  All things being equal, people would rather have more pay.<p>People always say that they are making enough at their level; but when the offer comes, it takes about 10% to get someone to move from Redmond to Seattle."
"I think the author is correct in the result, but not in the reasoning.  The vast majority of M.Sci thesis are not read because they are neither ground-breaking nor well written.<p>As for ground-breaking, they are only one year projects on average.  No one can expect much more from it.<p>The author's main critique is the style of the thesis, but here I think he is incorrect.  Research papers need to be concise and precise, and to do that they must use an agreed upon language and style.  The proper place for a casual style is in a survey or popular article (re: advertisement).<p>I think another reason that one shouldn't expect their thesis to be read is that a M.Sc thesis is usually the first full publication of the author, while even a PhD thesis is too often the collation of the author's first publications.  One simply does't have the practice necessary to write a great paper.<p>Also, it is good to remember that the audience of a thesis the review committee.  It is not written as a dialog in the research community as a journal article or conference paper is.  Most advisors will not push for style changes or expanded references because at that would engage a larger review."
"Try (as much as possible) to stick to GAAP standards and you'll be fine.<p>Choosing how/when you depreciate certain assets, or if you use a FIFO or LIFO inventory process is all well and good.  But you would still have 1 single set of accounting books/data.<p>I never enjoyed the accounting part of the companies I've started, but I've learned there are things you <i>could</i> do, things you <i>should</i> do and things that you <i>shouldn't</i> do.  There is not a whole lot of room for interpretation, especially if you want to try to raise money or sell the company at any point."
"Good points.  But keep in mind that YC and typical Angel's bring some things of value like:<p>- Other high-level industry contacts
- Experience
- Proven track record.<p>How does the OP compare in those regards, because that is (IMO) what establishes value more than what your head count is in proportion to the rest of the company."
"Wow, that's a whole lot of non-info.<p>As some of the comments sort-of point out, a major part of bandwidth pricing is loop costs and density.  $2,000/mo buys you a lot more bandwidth in a big colo facility than it buys you at your off-net office park.<p>Like many other things, bandwidth gets cheaper per/MB when you commit to higher rates and amounts.  Just like real-estate, buying 100 acres of undeveloped land is far less expensive than buying 100 individual undeveloped 1 acre parcels.<p>And to carry the real-estate analogy further, there is a ""location"" aspect.  Not all pipes are the same, there are Tier-1 carriers and Tier-Shit carriers.<p>So, the ultimate answer is: ""It depends.  A lot."""
"Funny story, I have interviewed guys like this.  There are times in interviews where I have wished there was a giant ""EJECT"" button, or some mechanism similar to those stupid ""talent"" shows where you can just abruptly cancel someones performance at the point you know it is hopeless."
"I know all this.  I also know that people will forget to turn their phones off, will have phones and laptops and all manner of devices in checked luggage that are possibly left on, and that these signals are all around the plane anyway.<p>If there were any credible threat from leaving your phone on, or having it actively transmitting, then ALL phones would be outright banned from the plane. Otherwise, a group of terrorists could take down a plane simply by passively not turning their phones off? When you look at all of the other TSA security theater bullshit, it's a safe conclusion (IMO) that the RF from your phone will not interfere with the operation of the plane, based on the simple fact that they are not banned in the first place.<p>Not to mention, I think that if this were even a moderate concern it would be easy to equip the flight attendants with an RF monitoring device they could walk down the aisle with and detect close-proximity transmitters from cell phones.<p>On modern flights where coach seats have been spaced at the minimum allowable level and people are forced to bring everything as carry on to avoid bagge fees you see far more safety threats from under-seat luggage sticking out into the seating aisle, potentially inhibiting safe exit of the plane in an actual emergency."
"<i>Should I be allowed to sign up for the one year term, and then cancel my credit card after a couple months?</i><p>Yes, you should.  Because it's not the credit card companies responsibility to worry about what outstanding contracts you may or may not still have ongoing.<p>It would be up to the merchant to pursue legal action if your attempt to defraud the contract was substantial enough for them to care.  If this was an ongoing problem for them, they would have to debate if their ""deal"" is really valued by their consumers and worth continuing to offer.<p>But, it's not Visa's problem to worry about these things."
"I'm not sure if this is what you were saying, but you should NEVER have 2 sets of actual accounting books.  The numbers are the numbers, the truth is the truth.<p>You can create and present a document that shows your <i>expectations</i> and <i>assumptions</i>, but you can't say you made X amount of sales and Y amount of profit when the real numbers are different.<p>In reality though, the data you show and present should be realistic and perhaps slightly cautious.  This is what you are going to be measured against.  Being ""incredibly optimistic"" when you do not believe this to be true is really kind of fraudulent.<p>Set expectations for what can reasonably happen with the resources/constraints you are working with.  Internally, manage your capital as if it were your last dollar.  If you do not meet the expectations set, determine why."
"IANAL...<p>It's pretty common, I can recall lots of these cases around IPOs that didn't sky rocket as planned.<p>This one may be a little more unique because NASDAQ seems to have had actual technical issues with the IPOD. Given the current stock proceed of FB though, I'm curious how their argument is framed."

"I think you'll generally find that Digg is a big waste of time in terms of promoting a site.  It takes a reasonable amount of effort to get anywhere near the front page, and then when you do you get a crush of mostly unqualified traffic from users who are not likely to ever visit your site again.<p>Self-submissions and ""Digg groups"" rarely ever work to elevate you above the bowels of the ""Upcoming"" pages.  One of the things that Digg seems to be particularly good at is detecting this sort of activity.<p>Your time is better spent improving your app and promoting it where it is relevant.  Wait for someone else to take an interest in it and let them submit to Digg/Mixx/etc."
"I've done some enterprise sales as well, and I think it depends a lot on what you're selling vs. what they're buying.<p>If you have the right product, the enterprise sale is a rigorous, but also fun and rewarding process.  If you have the wrong product (as in the case of my last company), the enterprise sales process is like trying to push a boulder uphill against a headwind on a mountain made of teflon."
"This is just from my perspective...  For background, I usually own one or more departments in a typical startup, ranging from Pre-Sales Engineering to Customer Support, to IT.  In every case when I hire someone I have a set of what I consider to be reasonable expectations:<p>They will have a method to get to work reliably.<p>They will have a method to bathe regularly<p>They will have a method to be contacted after-hours in case of emergency (land-line and/or cell phone)<p>They will have a method to be contacted and respond electronically after-hours.<p>During the Interview stage, and in any offer letters, I make it clear that if you want to take a job at a startup you are going to be doing the work of 1.5 - 2.5 ""standard"" employees.  We might not have a budget or requirement for 24.7 staffing, but things WILL happen after hours from time to time, and unless there are extreme circumstances you WILL be expected to act in a reasonable amount of time to respond to or resolve the issue.<p>So, I generally expect my employees to have basic connectivity and reachability after hours.  Sometimes, depending on the scenario, the company will subsidize some or all their cell-phone or cable-modem bill, especially if either are used ""significantly"" for their work.  At the same time, I wouldn't pay for someones car, or clothing, or heat bill.  Cable modem/Internet at home is usually NOT subsidized unless the employee is a pure telecommuter.<p>Maybe my expectations are illogical, but of course <i>I</i> don't think so ;)"
"Right.  Because the beans pick, deliver, roast, grind and brew themselves.<p>I haven't been to Posies cafe, but the local independent coffee place I stop at most days on my way into the office charges less than $2.00 for all 3 size options (12, 16, 20oz), deals almost exclusively with organic sustainable save-the-planet type growers, has beans from around the world, and a top-notch large batch roaster in house (which someone has to staff for pretty much the entire roasting period).<p>If they were actually charging $4 for a ""caffeine water"", then they shouldn't be bitching about Groupon (IMO).  If they're charging the more typical ~$2 for coffee, ~$4 for an espresso drink, then their prices are pretty reasonable, and you have to sell a fuck-ton of cups to make your rent.<p>Isn't almost <i>everything</i> entirely dependent on two parties agreeing that it is worth the given asking price?"
"Ahh.  Interesting bit of clarification.  In either case, it's hard to argue as everything is theoretical at this point.  Maybe they could not have justified taking on your project at all if they didn't farm it out to this freelancer.<p>So, for your budget (and I'm way over simplifying here) you could have gone elsewhere and gotten work more or less of the caliber of this person working through a lesser firm, or gone to this name-brand firm where the <i>work</i> would not have been done by an a-lister, but the project management and creative oversight <i>would</i> have been handled by them.  Theoretically, they would have ensured an outcome on-par with their reputation, even if they potentially had to do some internal re-work if her output wasn't up to snuff.<p>This sounds, to me, like the scenario where the design firm was trying to expand their business a little bit and was doing so on a trial basis, with you and her both effectively as guinea pigs.  I've seen this work really well and really poorly.  If their signature is at the point where it can be easily reproduced under guidance, then you missed a good opportunity.  If their style cannot be implemented by anyone other than these 4 or 5 people, you got lucky.<p>If I had to flip a coin though, I'm guessing you gave up a good opportunity here..."
"Usually when I've submitted a dupe story, if it already exists it just adds a vote to the pre-existing story.<p>Where the logic either breaks (or allows people to subvert it) is where different URL's can get you to the same story.  Often times URL's contain some superfluous flags that don't change the content served, but just serve to log some referrer or layout type data (I'm sure everyone reading this site gets how this works).  Adding, removing, or changing any of this data seems to pretty much break or confuse whatever dupe-detector logic exists."
"I don't think this argument is analogous.<p>With a CATV subscription, you can hook up an essentially unlimited number of TVs.  You <i>could</i> in theory watch every channel 24/7 for the same basic rate.  The basic costs associated with cable are related to the infrastructure to bring the signal to your house, plus whatever licensing fees for content that are essentially passed through.<p>With Internet plans, we are charged repetitively for multiple devices, and in essence you are basically discouraged (throttling, excess usage fees) from actually using the service to 100% of the contracted rates over the billing period.<p>For example, I have on my account 2 iPhones with data plans (mine, wife's), 1 with tethering (mine), and 1 4G USB dongle.  I went over the 5G limit on the dongle, but both of the basic data plans on the iPhones were under budget for the month, and I hardly used the tethering.  Do you think I'll get a break from Verizon, or any kind of 'net usage' billing for the overage on the 4G dongle?<p>As others have pointed out in other threads, the mobile Internet space is ripe for disruption.  It's not going to come from 2 college drop-outs on a $15,000 Y Combinator budget, but it's going to happen as soon as the economy lights up a little bit and we get some real infrastructure investment rolling."
"It seems that Apple has historically concentrated more on pushing towards the future instead of dragging legacy support with them.<p>In the long run this means that users who don't make the investment to stay current hardware-wise often lose out on being able to take advantage of the latest features.<p>This certainly creates a good cash flow situation for Apple, but my guess is that the cost-avoidance side is equally lucrative.  Not having to run QA tests for hardware that is 3 revisions back, and possibly still running original or near-original code has got to look good on the bottom line as well.  Also, knowing that you can leave any mistakes or oversights in the past, and keep drivers for massively old legacy items out of the code base probably just makes for a better overall experience for everyone.<p>I once worked with one of the guys who was a kernel developer for Windows95.  According to him, a lot of the Windows bloat and slowness at startup was directly attributed to massive hardware base they had to maintain support for.  IMO, I personally <i>like</i> the fact that Apple doesn't waste a lot of time and effort on worrying that every new feature is fully back-portable to everything they've shipped in the last 5 years."

"To me this is quite obviously a very related issue.<p>As long as people refuse to recognize the moral interests of animals, it is not logically consistent for them to respect moral obligations to other humans.  The moral distinction between animals and humans is a completely arbitrary prejudice and should be immediately identified as such by anybody with even a basic understanding of evolutionary biology.<p>Humans <i>are</i> animals."
"That's an interesting criticism of OpenSSL.  Do you know of a general purpose cryptographic library that has done a better job than OpenSSL at hardening against side-channel attacks?<p>By default, OpenSSL has: RSA blinding, constant time montgomery multiplication, careful review and correction of the conditional branches which were attacked in that amazing series of branch prediction papers.<p>Doesn't seem to me that OpenSSL developers are careless and indifferent about side-channel attacks."
"Yeah, that talk is excellent.  For a double dose of optimism about the human race, follow it up with the Hans Rosling TED talks.  First he shows you some visualizations of economic data to convince you that we're not hopelessly fucked, then he swallows a sword.  I love that guy."

"Several of those patterns are incomplete or frowned upon:<p>* if a method does not use the object&#x27;s state (no `self` usage) make it a `class-` or `staticmethod`.<p>* Some magic methods are presented.

"<i>Turns out it's a simple matter of reading the iTunes music library XML catalog file on a customer's computer, and using that to create a sync capability for the Pre.</i><p>The author seems to mistakenly believe that this XML file is a documented and supported format for third-party interoperability with iTunes. It's not. The DTD he links to is that of plist files in general, and does not describe how iTunes stores its application-specific information in the file. The quote from the support article is not a message to third-party developers that they should use this file, simply a statement to users that it <i>is</i> used by other applications.<p>The <i>only</i> documented and supported methods of interacting with iTunes are with visualisation plug-ins, AppleScript, and the COM API."

"&#62;I don't see it as ""they"" are collecting the information.<p>This is an interesting distinction, that I don't really know where I stand.  _They_ wrote the software, but it runs on a device _you_ choose to own and operate.<p>Allow me to as a few hypothetical questions, that I don't want to imply relate to this situation, but instead challenge some notions of who the actor is in their context: If I get a virus that encrypts my files and demands ransom, did I do it to myself?  Do I run my website, or do I tell my hosting provider how to run it?  If I have a device that uses TPM to make me completely unable to change, modify or understand what the code on it does, am I the one performing the actions of the software or is the writer?  If I compute 2+2 serverside vs in javascript clientside, does that change who is doing the adding?  If it is the owner of the device is the actor, what if the software is (unbeknownst to the user) stealing credit card numbers from the POS terminal it is installed on.  Who is legally responsible then?<p>Software operates on its own, and can do so simultaneously for more than one party, with potentially conflicting interests.  I think our shuffle to the cloud is going to run into some complex ownership, responsibility, liability and transparency questions soon, I'm interested to see how it all shakes out."
